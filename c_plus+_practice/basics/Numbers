1) Write a program in C++ to check whether a given number is an ugly number or not (Ugly Number)
  -> # EXPLANATION: Ugly numbers are those number whose prime factors are 2, 3 or 5. From 1 to 15, there are 11 ugly numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15. 
                    The numbers 7, 11, 13 are not ugly because they are prime. The number 14 is not ugly because in its prime factor the 7 will come.

4) Write a program in C++ to check whether a given number is Deficient or not. 
  -> # EXPLANATION: a deficient number or defective number is a number n for which the sum of divisors of ''n'' is less than 2n.
                    Equivalently, it is a number for which the sum of proper divisors (or aliquot sum) is less than n.
