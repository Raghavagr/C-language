/*
These are some useful classes for working with files in C++

fstreambase
ifstream --> derived from fstreambase
ofstream --> derived from fstreambase
In order to work with files in C++, you will have to open it. Primarily, there are 2 ways to open a file:

Using the constructor
Using the member function open() of the class

An example program is shown below to demonstrate the concept of reading and writing files
*/

// write in file using constructor function
#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    string st = "Harry bhai";
    // Opening files using constructor and writing it
    ofstream out("sample60.txt"); // Write operation
    out<<st;

    return 0;
}

// Reading from file
#include<iostream>
#include<fstream>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    string st2;
    // Opening files using constructor and reading it
    ifstream in("sample60b.txt"); // Read operation
    in>>st2;
    getline(in, st2);  
    cout<<st2;

    return 0;
}
