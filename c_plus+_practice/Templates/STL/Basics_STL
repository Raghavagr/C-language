                                      ************* STANDARD TEMPLATE LIBRARY **********************

-- The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. 
-- It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. 
-- It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized.

STL has four components:-
1) Containers:- Object which store the data
2) Algorithms:- Procedure to process the data
3) Iterators:- Object which point to an element of an container
4) Functions:- Functors allow the working of the associated function to be customized with the help of parameters to be passed


1) CONTAINERS
There are 3 types of Containers -
 A) Sequence Containers:- It impliment the data structure in Linear Fashion.      EXAMPLE:   1-> 5-> 7-> 10-> 6   LINE THIS WAY
                            Sequence Container Include: -
                            i) Vector    -> Inclue Random Acess(RA) fast
                                            Insertion/ Deletion is slow at random or in between
                                            Insertion/ Deletion is fast at end
                            
                            ii) list      -> RA slow
                                             Insertion/ Deletion is fast in mid and random
                                             Insertion/ Deletion is fast at end
                            iii) deque
                            iv)  arrays
                            
  B) Associative Container:- Implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity) or Direct Acess
                              All the operations are Fast EXCEPT Random Acess(RA)
                              
                              Associative Container Includes -
                              i) SET
                              ii) MULTISET
                              iii) MAP/ MULTIMAP
                              
  C) Derived Containers:- Support Real World Modelling. 
                          IT INCLUDES-
                          i) Stack      -> LIFO
                          ii) Queue     -> FIFO
                          iii) Priority Queue
